# Hackintosh-EFI-for-the-HP-Prodesk-400-G3-DM
This is my own made and optimized EFI Folder for the HP ProDesk 400 G3 DM

My own Specs: 

CPU: 3,4 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5

Graphics: Intel HD 630 at 1536 MB. Cant seem to get more than that.

RAM: 8GB DDR4 @2400 MHz

SSD: 256GB Intenso (Sata)

macOS Version: Sonoma 14.7

Use Mac Identifier iMac18,1 (iMac19,1 also works for me)

If your Specs differ dont worry! This EFI will still work for you!
